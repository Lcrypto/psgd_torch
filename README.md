### Pytorch implementation of PSGD 
Currently, Pytorch demos with PSGD are given in Numpy implementations (https://github.com/lixilinx/psgd_np).

I will rewrite the file 'preconditioned_stochastic_gradient_descent.py' using torch.Tensor so that no need to go back to Numpy for preconditioner related operations.
